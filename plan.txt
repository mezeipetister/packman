 2 ways:
 =======
   - designing to save it as fast as possible
   - make each save process as a stand alone one with its own result
   - or queue all the save requests and save the last one, and with this
     approach make it different processes. Return immediately the result,
     which doesnt contain any detail about the outcome of file save,
     and try the save process in the background. But what happens if the
     save process could not managed? Should we have a safety plan for
     this situation, and after a few unsuccessful trial we should
     make an auto emergency save?
     
     
The way we save files
=====================
  - Writing bytes into a file is safe.
  - Until we brake the process during the buffer writing process. In this
    case the file is going to became corrupted.
